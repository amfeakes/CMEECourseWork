###Is Florida getting warmer?###
###AIMS####
#you need to calculate the correlation coefficients between temperature and time
#you will use a permutation analysis instead, by generating a distribution of random correlation coefficients 
#and compare your observed coefficient with this random distribution
#Compute the appropriate correlation coefficient between years and Temperature and store it (look at the help file for cor()
#Repeat this calculation a sufficient number of times, each time randomly reshuffling the temperatures
  #(i.e., randomly re-assigning temperatures to years), and recalculating the correlation coefficient (and storing it)
#Calculate what fraction of the random correlation coefficients were greater than the observed one 
#(this is your approximate, asymptotic p-value).
#Interpret and present the results: Present your results and their interpretation in a pdf document written in 
  #latex (include the the documentâ€™s source code in the submission) (Keep the writeup, including any figures, to one A4 page).
