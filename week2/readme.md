This script demonsrates working with csv's in python, it inputs a file from the data directory and outputs a new file into the results. 

[basic_io1.py](code/basic_io1.py)

This script shows how to input files, using a file from the data directory.

[basic_io2.py](code/basic_io2.py)

This script shows how to out files, saving a file into the results directory. 

[basic_io3.py](code/basic_io3.py)

This script shows how to store files in python.

[boilerplate.py](code/boilerplate.py)

This script is a boilerplate for python, it shows how to define the main functions of a script, then exits. 

[cfexercises1.py](code/cfexercises1.py)


This script shows the use of control statements, in a module form.

[cfexercises2.py](code/cfexercises2.py)

This script shows the use of loops and if (conditionals).

[control_flow.py](code/control_flow.py)

This script has functions to exemplify the use of control statements. 

[debugme.py](code/debugme.py)

This script demonstrates how debugging runs in python. 

[dictionary.py](code/dictionary.py)

This script demonstrates creating a dictionary using tupels. 

[lc1.py](code/lc1.py)

This script is based on writing list comprehensions and loops, to print the latin names, common names and mean body masses of bird species.

[lc2.py](code/lc2.py)

This script is based on writing list comprehensions and loops, to print lists of month names and rail levels where the amount of rain is greater than 100m, and the names of months with less than 50mm rainfall.

[loops.py](code/loops.py)

This script demonstrates examples of loops in python.

[myexamplescript.py](code/myexamplescript.py)

This is an example script in python, based on defining functions. 

[oaks.py](code/oaks.py)

This script shows examples of loops and list comprehensions.

[oaks_debugme.py](code/oaks_debugme.py)

This script is used to practise debugging and doctesting. 

[scope.py](code/scope.py)

This script shows examples of variable scope.

[sysargv.py](code/sysargv.py)

This script demonstrates sys.argv.

[test_control_flow.py](code/test_control_flow.py)

This script has functions to exemplify the use of control statements. 

[tuple.py](code/tuple.py)

This script shows how to  print information from nested tuples.

[using_name.py](code/using_name.py)

This script illustrates if __name__= __main__ function.

### Groupwork 

[align_seqs_fasta.py](code/align_seqs_fasta.py)
 This script is used to align two DNA sequences in the best possible way. It uses inputs of any two fasta files, and will use defaults if no files are provided.

[align_seqs_better.py](code/align_seqs_better.py)
This script is used to align two DNA sequences, providing all equally-best alignments in a text output, in the results directory.

[oaks_groupwork.py](code/oaks_groupwork.py) This improves the oaks.py script to include column headers.
