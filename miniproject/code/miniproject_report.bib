	abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst’s logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the ﬁrst two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve ﬁtting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst’s model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the “maximum speciﬁc growth rate” on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modiﬁed versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky’s square root model testiﬁes. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the “maximum speciﬁc growth rate.” Different methods to determine the “lag time” often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly deﬁned growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or aw, need not be “multiplicative” and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to conﬁrm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being “mechanistic” are perfectly suitable for this purpose.},

	abstract = {Microbial growth parameters are usually calculated from the fit of a growth model to a set of isothermal growth data gathered at several temperatures. In principle at least, it is also possible to derive them from non-isothermal (‘dynamic’) growth data. This requires the numerical solution of a rate model whose coefficients are nested terms that include the temperature profile. The methodology is demonstrated with simulated non-isothermal growth data on which random noise had been superimposed to emulate the scatter found in experimental microbial counts. The procedure has been validated by successful retrieval of the known generation parameters from the simulated growth curves. The method was then applied to experimental non-isothermal growth data of C. perfringens cells in cooled ground beef. The growth data collected under one cooling regime were used to predict the organism's growth patterns under different temperature histories. The practicality of the method is currently limited because of the relatively large scatter found in experimental microbial growth data and the relatively low frequency at which they are collected. But if and when the scatter could be reduced and the counts taken at short time intervals, the method could be used to determine the growth model in situ thus enabling to translate the changing temperature during processing, transportation or storage into a corresponding growth curve of the organism in question.},

Using the experimental data obtained at the constant temperatures, the new logistic model was studied for growth prediction at a dynamic temperature.

However, evaluating bacterial growth with microplate readers has been hurdled by barriers such as multiple scattering. Here, we report our development of a method based on the time derivatives of the optical density (OD) and/or fluorescence (FL) of bacterial cultures to overcome these barriers. First, we illustrated our method using quantitative models and numerical simulations, which predicted the number of bacteria and the number of fluorescent proteins in time as well as their time derivatives. Then, we systematically investigated how the time derivatives depend on the parameters in the models/simulations, providing a framework for understanding the FL growth curves. In addition, as a demonstration, we applied our method to study the lag time elongation of bacteria subjected to treatment with silver (Ag
              +
              ) ions and found that the results from our method corroborated well with that from growth curve fitting by the Gompertz model that has been commonly used in the literature. Furthermore, this method was applied to the growth of bacteria in the presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at various concentrations, where the OD curve measurements failed. We showed that our method allowed us to successfully extract the growth behavior of the bacteria from the FL measurements and understand how the growth was affected by the AgNPs.},

	abstract = {We developed a simulation method, known as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) to measure potential effects of uncertainty and variation in vital rates on population growth (␭) for purposes of species conservation planning. Under LSA, we specify plausible or hypothesized levels of uncertainty, variation, and covariation in vital rates for a given population. We use these data under resampling simulations to establish random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and ﬁnally summarize results from the matrix replicates to estimate potential effects of each vital rate on ␭ in a probabilitybased context. Estimates of potential effects are based on a variety of summary statistics, such as frequency of replicates having the same vital rate of highest elasticity, difference in elasticity values calculated under simulated conditions vs. elasticities calculated using mean invariant vital rates, percentage of replicates having positive population growth, and variation in ␭ explained by variation in each vital rate. To illustrate, we applied LSA to vital rates for two vertebrates: desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and Greater Prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Results for the prairie chicken indicated that a single vital rate consistently had greatest effect on population growth. Results for desert tortoise, however, suggested that a variety of life stages could have strong effects on population growth. Additional simulations for the Greater Prairie Chicken under a hypothetical conservation plan also demonstrated that a variety of vital rates could be manipulated to achieve desired population growth. To improve the reliability of inference, we recommend that potential effects of vital rates on ␭ be evaluated using a probability-based approach like LSA. LSA is an important complement to other methods that evaluate vital-rate effects on ␭, including classical elasticity analysis, retrospective methods of variance decomposition, and simulation of the effects of environmental stochasticity.},

	abstract = {We argue that population growth rate is the key unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of population growth rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that population growth rate is also central to our understanding of environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a population reduce population growth rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where population growth rate is greater than zero (where population growth rate =
              r
              = log
              e
              (
              N
              
                t
                +1

                t
              
              )). While environmental stressors have negative effects on population growth rate, the same is true of population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well–known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when population growth rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which population growth rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear; in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above.
            
            
              Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of population growth rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on population growth rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on population growth rate of population density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod,
              Tisbe battagliae
              . Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of population growth rate.},

The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and a w, change with time.},
